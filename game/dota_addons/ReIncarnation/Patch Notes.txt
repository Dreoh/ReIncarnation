-Version 0.1.4d
-Fixed problem where items that were not in inventory upon class change could not be used after
-Skip walls in swamp replaced with trigger entities.
-Can now walk anywhere in swamp, but walking off the path causes minimum movement speed (it IS a swamp after all)
-=- I am currently researching lowering minimum move speed
-Added -suicide command
-=- used for if hero gets stuck
-=- Can only be used when hero is at 75% health or higher (this is to prevent abuse)
